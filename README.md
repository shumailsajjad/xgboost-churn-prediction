# XGBoost Churn Prediction

This notebook utilizes the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from **IBM** (originally available on Kaggle) to predict customers who are likely to opt-out of the services offered by the telecom company. 

I have used a different approach compared to the original Kaggle notebook, inspired by Josh Starmerâ€™s video on StatQuest.

The process includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and preprocess the dataset.
- **XGBoost classification** model for churn prediction.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.
